            Born in 1996, I grew up during the digital rise. As a teenager, I
            started building my first websites and got more and more interested
            in the digital economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            After school, I started to study{' '}
            <span className='underline'>
              Computer Science as a bachelor&apos;s degree
            </span>{' '}
            at Singidunum University and completed many online courses
            alongside.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a passionate, energetic, and self-motivated junior{' '}
            <span className='underline'>full-stack software developer</span>{' '}
            eager to turn ideas into applications. My ambitions are to stay on
            the leading edge of the{' '}
            <span className='underline'>web development</span> industry and find
            new learning opportunities or projects to keep improving rapidly as
            a developer.

            Out of the office, you will find me dreaming of basketball, playing
            video games, and petting all the good cats.
